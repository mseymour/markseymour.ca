    description: The portfolio system is developed using a single Markdown file with YAML front matter for configuring page metadata and gallery items. This also allows me to consolidate information on a per-item basis, including the main "feature" image and additional gallery images, which are all displayed on this page.

This project was developed as a part of my overall personal branding and marketing system that I created in late 2018â€“early 2019.

I chose to use [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/) for this project as I wanted to learn [React](https://reactjs.org/) more on my own time while seeking gainful employment, and also keeps my skills from becoming out of date.

I invite you to visit the site's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mseymour/markseymour.ca/) to check out how I built it!
